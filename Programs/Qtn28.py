'''
Write a program to compute:

f(n)=f(n-1)+100 when n>0
and f(0)=1

with a given n input by console (n>0).

Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:

5

Then, the output of the program should be:

500

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

'''

def f(n):
    #print (n)
    if n > 0:
        return f(n-1) + 100
    else:
        return 0


val = int(input())
print (f(val))

'''
The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:


f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1

Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.

Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:

7

Then, the output of the program should be:

13

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
